## General

- Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- Do not preserve backward compatibility. Remove obsolete paths instead of
  adding compatibility layers, fallbacks, or migrations.
- Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current
  requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, configuration, and
  indirection.
- Grow the system in layers. Start from the smallest version that works end
  to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works.
  Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.
- Keep components modular and concerns clearly separated.
- Prefer established, well-maintained libraries when they reduce overall
  complexity or improve reliability. Do not reimplement common functionality
  without a clear reason.
- Lean on the dependencies already in the project before writing your own
  implementation or adding packages. Do not assume a library lacks a
  capability without checking its documentation and types.
- Make architectural decisions for the long term. Do not accept a stopgap
  that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.
- Study how established products solve the problem before designing a
  solution. Adopt their proven patterns and conventions rather than inventing
  an approach from scratch.

## Superpowers workflow overrides

(These outrank skill defaults.)

- Specs -> `.superpowers/specs/`, plans -> `.superpowers/plans/` (repo root).
  Never commit them; a single `.gitignore` containing `*` in `.superpowers/`
  keeps it all untracked.
- No spec-review step: summarize the spec inline, flag assumptions/open
  questions, wait for my reply before writing-plans.
- Worktrees: always create one before changing code, no consent prompt (unless
  already isolated); use `.worktrees/<branch>`. Skip the check-ignore gate and
  never touch repo `.gitignore`s -- after creating the worktree, drop a
  `.gitignore` containing `*` in `.worktrees/` instead.
- Finishing a branch: skip the menu, always "keep as-is"; report branch and
  worktree path.
